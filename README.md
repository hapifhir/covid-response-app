## Patient App

This application is an self-assessment COVID-19 tool.  The latest deployed Version can be found at the [patient app demo](https://covid19.smilecdr.com/covid-response-app/).

For installing and running, check out [the patient app README](./tree/master/patient-app) for getting started on this project.

# FHIR Version

The repository and APIs use the latest [FHIR-R4](http://hl7.org/fhir/) version.

The application requires a FHIR server.  The demos are tested using the open source [Hapi-FHIR](https://hapifhir.io/) server, but any FHIR compliant server should work.
